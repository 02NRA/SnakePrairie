## Contents
- Make potion of glow using glow berries (variants hopefully coming in the future)
- Craft a shiv for a quick and cheap weapon
- Slingshots are a new projectile weapon with high knockback and low durability; they fire pebbles made from gravel
- Clean glass with a brush to make it clearer (the apparent darkness is a bug, though it doesn't actually block light)
- Use tinted glass and eyes of ender to make a looking glass and see what could never be seen before
